# Movie-Review-Generator

## Aim
To create a RNN Neural Network model which is capable of generating movie reviews given a prompt.

## Libraries Used
Tensorflow and Keras

## Dataset Details
The IMDB movie review, sentiment analysis dataset was used to train the model. The model was fed with both positive and negative reviews during training.

Note that it takes a suffiecient number of epochs before the model can start generating legible reviews.

## Sample Output
After 20 epochs: *this movie is a must see . a lot of the plot revolves around a group of soldiers who discover a japanese soldiers under attack force of their monsters or are they [UNK] . the film is not bad .*

The python code and the notebook are available in this repository
